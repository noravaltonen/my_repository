###DAY 3 EXERCISES COMMENTS###


Part 1: Numpy exercises

Done. Check jupyter notebook Nora_day3_exercises_1_2

Part 2: Speed optimization using Numpy

Done. Check jupyter notebook Nora_day3_exercises_1_2. This also ties in to day 2 exercises. I sort of combined them into something of a better optimization. Check the actual time optimization in the Day_2_exercises readme file.

Part 3: Examples on classes and inheritance

Check the classroom folder. To obtain the Teacher's name and course, do as follow:

from classroom import Teacher
me = Teacher('firstname', 'lastname', 'course')
me.printNameCourse

To obtain the student's name and subject

from classroom import Student
me = Student('firstname', 'lastname', 'subject')
me.printNameSubject

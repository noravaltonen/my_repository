###DAY 4 EXERCISES###


1. Speed optimization with Cython

I created the files, but I seem to be having a lot of issues with cython in my computer. It freezes my terminal everytime I try to run the %timeit on the cythonized file.

2. MPI Parallelization

See the files created.

3. Plotting with matplotlib

See the jupyter notebook. I have already created many plots with matplotlib, so I chose to create some plots using an effective area file.

4. Testing code with py.test

See files. Test passed in 0.07 seconds.

5.Create documentation

For some reason I have issues with docstrings. Everytime I have tried using them, it complains about indentations. I cannot find anything helpful on the internet. The code that has the documentation is called simple_math_doc.py

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated since I want to learn how to document code.

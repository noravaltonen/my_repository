Comments for day 1 exercises:


Part 1: Basic shell commands

Completed. I tested the file uploaded on Davinci 'hello_world_nora.py'.

Part 2: 

I configured my git. I opened a fork in participants. I pushed my own file (noravaltonen.md). I created a branch (test nora) and then edited viktor's file and I pushed it.
